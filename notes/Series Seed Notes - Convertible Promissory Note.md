# CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE

**Note Series**: [*_________*]

**Date of Note**: [*_________*]

**Principal Amount of Note**: $[*_________*]


For value received [Company Name], a Delaware corporation (the "**_Company_**"), promises to pay to the undersigned holder or such party's assigns (the "**_Holder_**") the principal amount set forth above with [simple] interest on the outstanding principal amount at the rate of [___]%per annum[, compounded annually]. Interest shall commence with the date hereof and shall continue on the outstanding principal amount until paid in full or converted. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days for the actual number of days elapsed.  All unpaid interest and principal shall be due and payable upon request of the Majority Holders on or after [*_________*] (the "**_Maturity Date_**").

## 1. BASIC TERMS.

### 1.1 Series of Notes.

This convertible promissory note (the "**_Note_**") is issued as part of a series of notes designated by the Note Series above (collectively, the "**_Notes_**")[, and having an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $[*_________*]] and issued in a series of multiple closings to certain persons and entities (collectively, the "**_Holders_**").  The Company shall maintain a ledger of all Holders.

### 1.3 Prepayment.

The Company may not prepay this Note prior to the Maturity Date without the consent of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes (the "**_Majority Holders_**").

### [1.4 Most Favored Nations.

If, while this Note is outstanding, the Company issues other indebtedness of the Company convertible into equity securities of the Company, or amends any existing indebtedness convertible into equity securities of the Company, and such newly issued or amended indebtedness would have material terms that are more favorable, from the perspective of the Holder (the "**_Other Debt_**"), than the terms of this Note, then the Company will provide the Holder with written notice thereof, together with a copy of all documentation relating to the Other Debt and, upon request of the Holder, any additional information related to the Other Debt as may be reasonably requested by the Holder.  The Company will provide such notice to the Holder promptly (and in any event within 30 days) following the issuance of the Other Debt.  In the event the Holder determines that the terms of the Other Debt are preferable to the terms of this Note, the Holder will notify the Company in writing within five days following the Holder's receipt of such notice from the Company.  Promptly after receipt of such written notice from the Holder, but in any event within 30 days, the Company will amend and restate this Note to be substantially identical to the promissory note evidencing the Other Debt, excluding the principal and unpaid accrued interest.]

## 2. CONVERSION AND REPAYMENT.

### 2.1 Conversion upon a Qualified Financing.

In the event that the Company issues and sells shares of its equity securities ( "**_Equity Securities_**") to investors (the "**_Investors_**") [on or before the Maturity Date][while this Note remains outstanding] in an equity financing with total proceeds to the Company of not less than $[**_________**] (excluding the conversion of the Notes or other convertible securities issued for capital raising purposes (_e.g._, Simple Agreements for Future Equity)) (a "**_Qualified Financing_**"), then the outstanding principal amount of this Note and any unpaid accrued interest shall automatically convert in whole without any further action by the Holder into Equity Securities sold in the Qualified Financing at a conversion price equal to [the cash price paid per share for Equity Securities by the Investors in the Qualified Financing[ multiplied by 0.[*__*]].][the lesser of (i) the cash price paid per share for Equity Securities by the Investors in the Qualified Financing[ multiplied by 0.[*__*]], and (ii) the quotient resulting from dividing $[*_________*] by the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company [immediately prior to the Qualified Financing ][as of the date of the Note ](assuming conversion of all securities convertible into Common Stock and exercise of all outstanding options and warrants, [including all shares of Common Stock reserved and available for future grant under any equity incentive or similar plan of the Company, and/or any equity incentive or similar plan to be created or increased in connection with the Qualified Financing,] but excluding the shares of equity securities of the Company issuable upon the conversion of Notes or other convertible securities issued for capital raising purposes (_e.g._, Simple Agreements for Future Equity)).]  The issuance of Equity Securities pursuant to the conversion of this Note shall be upon and subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to Equity Securities sold in the Qualified Financing.[Notwithstanding this paragraph, if the conversion price of the Notes as determined pursuant to this paragraph (the "**_Conversion Price_**") is less than the price per share at which Equity Securities are issued in the Qualified Financing, the Company may, solely at its option, elect to convert this Note into shares of a newly created series of preferred stock having the identical rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions as the Equity Securities issued in the Qualified Financing, and otherwise on the same terms and conditions, other than with respect to (if applicable): (i) the per share liquidation preference and the conversion price for purposes of price-based anti-dilution protection, which will equal the Conversion Price; and (ii) the per share dividend, which will be the same percentage of the Conversion Price as applied to determine the per share dividends of the Investors in the Qualified Financing relative to the purchase price paid by the Investors.]

### 2.2 Optional Conversion at non-Qualified Financing. 

In the event the Company consummates, [on or before the Maturity Date][while this Note remains outstanding], an equity financing pursuant to which it sells shares of Preferred Stock in a transaction that does not constitute a Qualified Financing, then the [Majority Holders][Holder] shall have the option to treat such equity financing as a Qualified Financing on the same terms set forth herein.

### 2.3 Maturity Date Conversion.

In the event that this Note remains outstanding on the Maturity Date, then the outstanding principal balance of this Note and any unpaid accrued interest shall [automatically without any further action by the Holder][upon the election of the Majority Holders given prior to the Maturity Date,][upon the election of the Holder given prior to the Maturity Date,] convert as of the Maturity Date into shares of [the Company's Common Stock][a newly created series of the Company's preferred stock on the terms and conditions set forth on **Exhibit A**] at a conversion price equal to the quotient resulting from dividing $[*_________*] by the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company [as of the Maturity Date][as of the date of the Note] (assuming conversion of all securities convertible into Common Stock and exercise of all outstanding options and warrants, [including all shares of Common Stock reserved and available for future grant under any equity incentive or similar plan of the Company,] but excluding the shares of equity securities of the Company issuable upon the conversion of Notes or other convertible securities issued for capital raising purposes (_e.g._, Simple Agreements for Future Equity)).

### 2.4 Change of Control.

If the Company consummates a Change of Control (as defined below) while this Note remains outstanding, the Company shall repay the Holder in cash in an amount equal to [(i) ]the outstanding principal amount of this Note plus any unpaid accrued interest on the original principal[, plus (ii) a repayment premium equal to [*___*]% of the outstanding principal amount of this Note][; provided, however, that upon the written election of the Holder made not less than five days prior to the Change of Control, the Company shall convert the outstanding principal balance of this Note and any unpaid accrued interest into shares of the Company's Common Stock at a conversion price equal to the quotient resulting from dividing $[*_________*] by the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company [immediately prior to the Change of Control][as of the date of the Note] (assuming conversion of all securities convertible into Common Stock and exercise of all outstanding options and warrants, but excluding the shares of equity securities of the Company issuable upon the conversion of Notes or other convertible securities issued for capital raising purposes (_e.g._, Simple Agreements for Future Equity))].  For purposes of this Note, a "**_Change of Control_**" means (i) a consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, other than any such consolidation, merger or reorganization in which the shares of capital stock of the Company immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization continue to represent a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization; (ii) any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in which in excess of 50% of the Company's voting power is transferred; or (iii) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, or the exclusive license of all or substantially all of the Company's material intellectual property; provided that a Change of Control shall not include any transaction or series of transactions principally for bona fide equity financing purposes in which cash is received by the Company or any successor, indebtedness of the Company is cancelled or converted or a combination thereof. The Company shall give the Holder notice of a Change of Control not less than 10 days prior to the anticipated date of consummation of the Change of Control.  Any repayment pursuant to this paragraph in connection with a Change of Control shall be subject to any required tax withholdings, and may be made by the Company (or any party to such Change of Control or its agent) following the Change of Control in connection with payment procedures established in connection with such Change of Control.

### 2.5 Procedure for Conversion.

The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver the capital stock into which this Note may convert until the Holder has surrendered this Note to the Company and delivered to the Company any such documentation.  Upon the conversion of this Note into capital stock pursuant to the terms hereof, in lieu of any fractional shares to which the Holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay the Holder cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the price at which this Note converts.

### 2.6 Interest Accrual.

If a Change of Control or Qualified Financing is consummated, all interest on this Note shall be deemed to have stopped accruing as of a date selected by the Company that is up to 10 days prior to the signing of the definitive agreement for the Change of Control or Qualified Financing.

## 3. Representations and Warranties.

### 3.1 Representations and Warranties of the Company.

The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Holder as of the date the first Note was issued as follows:

3.1.1 **Organization, Good Standing and Qualification.**  The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.  The Company has the requisite corporate power to own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted.  The Company is duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in all jurisdictions in which the nature of its activities and of its properties (both owned and leased) makes such qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions in which failure to do so would not have a material adverse effect on the Company or its business (a "**_Material Adverse Effect_**").

3.1.2 **Corporate Power.**  The Company has all requisite corporate power to issue this Note and to carry out and perform its obligations under this Note.  The Company's Board of Directors (the "**_Board_**") has approved the issuance of this Note based upon a reasonable belief that the issuance of this Note is appropriate for the Company after reasonable inquiry concerning the Company's financing objectives and financial situation.

3.1.3 **Authorization.**  All corporate action on the part of the Company, the Board and the Company's stockholders necessary for the issuance and delivery of this Note has been taken.  This Note constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, the relief of debtors and, with respect to rights to indemnity, subject to federal and state securities laws.  Any securities issued upon conversion of this Note (the "**_Conversion Securities_**"), when issued in compliance with the provisions of this Note, will be validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, free of any liens or encumbrances and issued in compliance with all applicable federal and securities laws.

3.1.4 **Governmental Consents.**  All consents, approvals, orders or authorizations of, or registrations, qualifications, designations, declarations or filings with, any governmental authority required on the part of the Company in connection with issuance of this Note has been obtained.

3.1.5 **Compliance with Laws.**  To its knowledge, the Company is not in violation of any applicable statute, rule, regulation, order or restriction of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or agency thereof in respect of the conduct of its business or the ownership of its properties, which violation of which would have a Material Adverse Effect. 

3.1.6 **Compliance with Other Instruments.**  The Company is not in violation or default of any term of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or of any provision of any mortgage, indenture or contract to which it is a party and by which it is bound or of any judgment, decree, order or writ, other than such violation(s) that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The execution, delivery and performance of this Note will not result in any such violation or be in conflict with, or constitute, with or without the passage of time and giving of notice, either a default under any such provision, instrument, judgment, decree, order or writ or an event that results in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets of the Company or the suspension, revocation, impairment, forfeiture, or nonrenewal of any material permit, license, authorization or approval applicable to the Company, its business or operations or any of its assets or properties.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Company has obtained all waivers reasonably necessary with respect to any preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights, including any notice or offering periods provided for as part of any such rights, in order for the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder without any third party obtaining any rights to cause the Company to offer or issue any securities of the Company as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder.

For purposes of this Note, "**_Company Covered Persons_**" are those persons specified in Rule 506(d)(1) under the Act; provided, however, that Company Covered Persons do not include (a) any Holder, or (b) any person or entity that is deemed to be an affiliated issuer of the Company solely as a result of the relationship between the Company and any Holder.
