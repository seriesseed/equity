#### 5.3 Procedures.  

If the Company proposes to undertake an issuance of New Securities, it shall give notice to each Major Purchaser of its intention to issue New Securities (the "Notice"), describing the type of New Securities and the price and the general terms upon which the Company proposes to issue the New Securities.  Each Major Purchaser will have (10) days from the date of notice, to agree in writing to purchase such Major Purchaser's Pro Rata Share of such New Securities for the price and upon the general terms specified in the Notice by giving written notice to the Company and stating therein the quantity of New Securities to be purchased (not to exceed such Major Purchaser's Pro Rata Share).   

#### 5.4 Failure to Exercise.  

If the Major Purchasers fail to exercise in full the right of first refusal within the 10-day period, then the Company will have one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter to sell the New Securities with respect to which the Major Purchasers' rights of first refusal hereunder were not exercised, at a price and upon general terms not materially more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in the Company's Notice to the Major Purchasers.  If the Company has not issued and sold the New Securities within the 120-day period, then the Company shall not thereafter issue or sell any New Securities without again first offering those New Securities to the Major Purchasers pursuant to this Section 5.
