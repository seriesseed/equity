## AGREEMENT TERMS

### 1. PURCHASE AND SALE OF SERIES SEED PREFERRED STOCK.

#### 1.1 Sale and Issuance of Series Seed Preferred Stock.

1.1.1 The Company will adopt and file the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in substantially the form of Exhibit C attached to this Agreement (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time) (the "Restated Certificate") with the Secretary of State of the State of Incorporation on or before the Initial Closing.

1.1.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each investor listed as a purchaser on Schedule 1 (each, a "Purchaser") will purchase at the applicable Closing and the Company agrees to sell and issue to such Purchaser at such Closing that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock of the Company ("Series Seed Preferred Stock") set forth opposite such Purchaser's name on Schedule 1, at a purchase price per share equal to the Purchase Price.

#### 1.2 Closing; Delivery.

1.2.1 The initial purchase and sale of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock hereunder will take place remotely via the exchange of documents and signatures on the Agreement Date or any subsequent date on which one or more Purchasers execute counterpart signature pages to this Agreement and deliver the aggregate Purchase Price to the Company (such date, the "Initial Closing").

1.2.2 At any time and from time to time during the 90-day period immediately following the Initial Closing (the "Additional Closing Period"), the Company may, at one or more additional closings (each an "Additional Closing" and together with the Initial Closing, each, a "Closing"), without obtaining the signature, consent or permission of any of the Purchasers in the Initial Closing or any prior Additional Closing, offer and sell to investors (the "New Purchasers"), at a per share purchase price equal to the Purchase Price, up to that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock that is equal to the quotient of (x) Total Series Seed Investment Amount divided by (y) the Purchase Price, rounded up to the next whole share (the "Total Shares Authorized for Sale") less the number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock actually issued and sold by the Company at the Initial Closing and any prior Additional Closings.  New Purchasers may include Persons who are already Purchasers under this Agreement.  Each of the New Purchasers purchasing shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock at an Additional Closing will execute counterpart signature pages to this Agreement and each New Purchaser will, upon delivery by such New Purchaser and acceptance by the Company of such New Purchaser's signature page and delivery of the aggregate Purchase Price by such New Purchaser to the Company, become a party to, and bound by, this Agreement to the same extent as if such New Purchaser had been a Purchaser at the Initial Closing. Each New Purchaser will be deemed to be a Purchaser for all purposes under this Agreement as of the date of the applicable Additional Closing.

1.2.3 Promptly following each Closing, if required by the Company's governing documents, the Company will deliver to each Purchaser participating in that Closing a certificate representing the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock being purchased by that Purchaser at that Closing against payment of the aggregate Purchase Price therefor by check payable to the Company, by wire transfer to a bank account designated by the Company, by cancellation or conversion of indebtedness or other convertible securities of the Company issued primarily for capital raising purposes (e.g., simple agreement for future equity) to such Purchaser or by any combination of such methods.

### 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.  

The Company hereby represents and warrants to each Purchaser that, except as set forth on the Disclosure Schedule attached as Exhibit D to this Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule"), if any, which exceptions are deemed to be part of the representations and warranties made in this Agreement, the following representations are true and complete as of the Agreement Date, except as otherwise indicated.

The Company is duly qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would have a material adverse effect on the business, assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, financial condition, property, or results of operations of the Company.

#### 2.2 Capitalization.  

2.2.1 The authorized capital of the Company consists, immediately prior to the Initial Closing (unless otherwise noted), of the following:

The ratio determined by dividing (x) the Unallocated Post-Money Option Pool Shares by (y) the Fully-Diluted Share Number (as defined below) is equal to the Unallocated Post-Money Option Pool Percent.  All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were issued in material compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws.  The Stock Plan has been duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") and approved by the Company's stockholders.  The term "Fully Diluted Share Number" means that number of shares of the Company's capital stock equal to the sum of (i) all shares of the Company's capital stock (on an as-converted basis) issued and outstanding, assuming exercise or conversion of all options, warrants and other convertible securities and (ii) all shares of the Company's capital stock reserved and available for future grant under any equity incentive or similar plan.

2.2.2 There are no outstanding preemptive rights, options, warrants, conversion privileges or rights (including rights of first refusal or similar rights), orally or in writing, to purchase or acquire any securities from the Company including, without limitation, any shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, except for (a) the conversion privileges of Series Seed Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of the Restated Certificate and (b) the securities and rights described in this Agreement.

2.2.3 The Key Holders set forth on Schedule 1 (each a "Key Holder") hold that number of shares of Common Stock set forth opposite each Key Holder's name in Section 2.2.3 of the Disclosure Schedule (such shares, the "Key Holder Shares"). The Key Holder Shares are subject to vesting and/or the Company's repurchase right on the terms specified in Section 2.2.3 of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Key Holder Vesting Schedules"). Except as specified in Section 2.2.3 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Key Holders do not own or have any other rights to any other securities of the Company.

Other than the Key Holder Shares, which vest pursuant to the applicable Key Holder Vesting Schedules, (x) all options granted and Common Stock outstanding vest as follows: 25% of the shares vest one  year following the vesting commencement date, with the remaining 75% vesting in equal installments over the next three years and (y) no stock plan, stock purchase, stock option or other agreement or understanding between the Company and any holder of any equity securities or rights to purchase equity securities provides for acceleration or other changes in the vesting provisions or other terms of such agreement or understanding as the result of (i) termination of employment (whether actual or constructive), (ii) any merger, consolidated sale of stock or assets, change in control, or any other transaction by the Company, or (iii) the occurrence of any other event or combination of events.

#### 2.4 Authorization.  

All corporate action has been taken, or will be taken before the applicable Closing, on the part of the Board and stockholders that is necessary for the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the performance by the Company of the obligations to be performed by the Company as of the Agreement Date.  This Agreement, when executed and delivered by the Company, will constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms and conditions except (a) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, or (b) as limited by laws relating to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief, or other equitable remedies.

The Purchaser is able to fend for itself, can bear the economic risk of its investment, and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock.  If other than an individual, the Purchaser also represents it has not been organized for the purpose of acquiring the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock.

#### 3.11 No "Bad Actor" Designees.

If the Purchaser has the right to designate or participate in the designation of a Board Designee, the Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that, to the Purchaser's knowledge, no Disqualification Event is applicable to the Purchaser's initial designee named above except, if applicable, for a Disqualification Event as to which Rule 506(d)(2)(ii-iv) or (d)(3) of the Securities Act is applicable.  Any Board Designee to whom any Disqualification Event is applicable, except for a Disqualification Event as to which Rule 506(d)(2)(ii-iv) or (d)(3) of the Securities Act is applicable, is hereinafter referred to as a "Disqualified Designee".

If the Company issues securities in its next equity financing after the date hereof (the "Next Financing") that (a) have rights, preferences or privileges that are more favorable than the terms of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock, such as price-based anti-dilution protection, or (b) provide all such future investors other contractual terms such as registration rights, the Company will provide substantially equivalent rights to the Purchasers with respect to the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock (with appropriate adjustment for economic terms or other contractual rights), subject to such Purchaser's execution of any documents, including, if applicable, investor rights, co-sale, voting, and other agreements, executed by the investors purchasing securities in the Next Financing (such documents, the "Next Financing Documents").  Any Major Purchaser will remain a Major Purchaser for all purposes in the Next Financing Documents to the extent such concept exists. The Company will pay the reasonable fees and expenses, not to exceed $5,000 in the aggregate, of one counsel for the Purchasers in connection with the Purchasers' review, execution, and delivery of the Next Financing Documents.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to the provisions of Section 8.11, upon the execution and delivery of the Next Financing Documents by Purchasers holding a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock held by all Purchasers, this Agreement (excluding any then-existing and outstanding obligations) will be amended and restated by and into such Next Financing Documents and will be terminated and of no further force or effect.

If the Company elects not to exercise its right of first refusal with respect to a proposed transfer of the Company's outstanding securities by any Key Holder, the Company will assign such right of first refusal to the Major Purchasers.  In the event of such assignment, each Major Purchaser will have a right to purchase that portion of the securities proposed to be transferred by such Key Holder equal to the ratio of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock owned by such Major Purchaser, to (b) the number of shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock owned by all Major Purchasers.

#### 4.4 Reservation of Common Stock.  

The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance and delivery upon the conversion of Series Seed Preferred Stock, all Common Stock issuable from time to time upon conversion of that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock equal to the Total Shares Authorized for Sale, regardless of whether or not all such shares have been issued at such time.

### 5. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER; DRAG ALONG.

#### 5.1 Limitations on Disposition.  

Each Person owning of record shares of Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the conversion of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock and any shares of Common Stock issued as a dividend or other distribution with respect thereto or in exchange therefor or in replacement thereof (collectively, the "Securities") or any assignee of record of Securities (each such Person, a "Holder") will not make any disposition of all or any portion of any Securities unless:

(a) there is then in effect a registration statement under the Securities Act, covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made in accordance with such registration statement; or

(b) such Holder has notified the Company of the proposed disposition and has furnished the Company with a statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and, at the expense of such Holder or its transferee, with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such disposition will not require registration of such securities under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1(a) and Section 5.1(b), no such registration statement or opinion of counsel will be required: (i) for any transfer of any Securities in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 144 or Rule 144A, or (ii) for any transfer of any Securities by a Holder that is a partnership, limited liability company, corporation, or venture capital fund to (A) a partner of such partnership, a member of such limited liability company, or stockholder of such corporation, (B) an affiliate of such partnership, limited liability company or corporation (including, any affiliated investment fund of such Holder), (C) a retired partner of such partnership or a retired member of such limited liability company, or (D) the estate of any such partner, member, or stockholder, or (iii) for the transfer without additional consideration or at no greater than cost by gift, will, or intestate succession by any Holder to the Holder's spouse or lineal descendants or ancestors or any trust for any of the foregoing; provided that, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), the transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if the transferee were an original Purchaser under this Agreement.

#### 5.2 "Market Stand-Off" Agreement.  

 To the extent requested by the Company or an underwriter of securities of the Company, each Holder and Key Holder, and any transferee thereof (each, a "Stockholder"), shall not, without the prior written consent of the managing underwriters in the IPO (as defined below), offer, sell, make any short sale of, grant or sell any option for the purchase of, lend, pledge, otherwise transfer or dispose of (directly or indirectly), enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership (whether any such transaction is described above or is to be settled by delivery of Securities or other securities, in cash, or otherwise), any Securities or other shares of stock of the Company then owned by such Stockholder, or enter into an agreement to do any of the foregoing,  for up to 180 days following the effective date of the registration statement of the initial public offering of the Company (the "IPO") filed under the Securities Act. For purposes of this Section 5.2, "Company" includes any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company into which the Company merges or consolidates. The Company may place restrictive legends on the certificates representing the shares subject to this Section 5.2 and may impose stop transfer instructions with respect to the Securities and such other shares of stock of each Stockholder (and the shares or securities of every other Person subject to the foregoing restriction) until the end of such period. Each Stockholder shall enter into any agreement reasonably required by the underwriters to the IPO to implement the foregoing within any reasonable timeframe so requested.  The underwriters for any IPO are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.2 and shall have the right, power and authority to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.2 as though they were parties hereto.

#### 5.3 Drag Along Right.

If a Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in the Restated Certificate) is approved by each of (i) the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock then-outstanding (other than those issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock), (ii) the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock then issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock then-outstanding and (iii) the Board, then each Stockholder will vote (in person, by proxy or by action by written consent, as applicable) all shares of capital stock of the Company now or hereafter directly or indirectly owned of record or beneficially by such Stockholder (collectively, the "Shares") in favor of, and adopt, such Deemed Liquidation Event and to execute and deliver all related documentation and take such other action in support of the Deemed Liquidation Event as may reasonably be requested by the Company to carry out the terms and provision of this Section 5.3, including executing and delivering instruments of conveyance and transfer, and any purchase agreement, merger agreement, indemnity agreement, escrow agreement, consent, waiver, governmental filing, share certificates duly endorsed for transfer (free and clear of impermissible liens, claims and encumbrances) and any similar or related documents.  The obligation of any party to take the actions required by this Section 5.3 will not apply to a Deemed Liquidation Event if the other party involved in such Deemed Liquidation Event is an affiliate or stockholder of the Company holding more than 10% of the voting power of the Company.

#### 5.4 Exceptions to Drag Along Right.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Stockholder need not comply with Section 5.3 in connection with any proposed sale of the Company (the "Proposed Sale") unless:

(b) the Stockholder will not be liable for the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by any other Person in connection with the Proposed Sale, other than the Company (except to the extent that funds may be paid out of an escrow established to cover breach of representations, warranties, and covenants of the Company as well as breach by any stockholder of any identical representations, warranties and covenants provided by all stockholders);

(c) the liability for indemnification, if any, of the Stockholder in the Proposed Sale and for the inaccuracy of any representations and warranties made by the Company or its stockholders in connection with such Proposed Sale, is several and not joint with any other Person (except to the extent that funds may be paid out of an escrow established to cover breach of representations, warranties and covenants of the Company as well as breach by any stockholder of any identical representations, warranties, and covenants provided by all stockholders), and except as required to satisfy the liquidation preference of the Series Seed Preferred Stock, if any, is pro rata in proportion to, and does not exceed, the amount of consideration paid to such Stockholder in connection with such Proposed Sale;  

(d) liability will be limited to the Stockholder's applicable share (determined  based on the respective proceeds payable to each Stockholder in connection with the Proposed Sale in accordance with the provisions of the Restated Certificate) of a negotiated aggregate indemnification amount that applies equally to all Stockholders but that in no event exceeds the amount of consideration otherwise payable to the Stockholder in connection with the Proposed Sale, except with respect to claims related to  fraud by the Stockholder, the liability for which need not be limited as to the Stockholder;

(e) upon the consummation of the Proposed Sale, (i) each holder of each class or series of the Company's stock will receive the same form of consideration for such holder's shares of such class or series as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of such same class or series of stock unless the holders of a majority of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock then outstanding elect otherwise,  (ii) each holder of a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock will receive the same amount of consideration per share of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of such same series, (iii) each holder of Common Stock will receive the same amount of consideration per share of Common Stock as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of Common Stock, and (iv) unless the holders of a majority of Series Seed Preferred Stock then outstanding elect to receive a lesser amount, the aggregate consideration receivable by all holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock will be allocated among the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock on the basis of the relative liquidation preferences to which the holders of each respective series of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock are entitled in a Deemed Liquidation Event (assuming for this purpose that the Proposed Sale is a Deemed Liquidation Event) in accordance with the Restated Certificate in effect immediately prior to the Proposed Sale.

#### 5.5 Additional Stockholders.

In the event that, after the Agreement Date, the Company enters into an agreement with any Person to issue shares of capital stock of the Company to such Person, following which such Person will hold shares of capital stock of the Company constituting 1% or more of the Company's then outstanding capital stock (treating for this purpose all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of or conversion of outstanding options, warrants or convertible securities, as if exercised and/or converted or exchanged), then the Company will cause such Person, as a condition precedent to entering into such agreement, to become a party to this Agreement by executing a counterpart signature page to this Agreement or an adoption agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, agreeing to be bound by and subject to the terms of this Agreement as a Stockholder and thereafter such Person will be deemed a Stockholder for all purposes under this Agreement.
