1.1.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each investor listed as a “Purchaser” on Schedule 1 hereto (each “Purchaser” and together the “Purchasers”) agrees to purchase at the applicable Closing (as defined below) and the Company agrees to sell and issue to each Purchaser at such Closing that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock of the Company (“Series Seed Preferred Stock”) set forth opposite such Purchaser’s name on Schedule 1, at a purchase price per share equal to the Purchase Price. 

#### 1.2 Closing; Delivery.

1.2.1	The initial purchase and sale of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock hereunder shall take place remotely via the exchange of documents and signatures on the Agreement Date or the subsequent date on which one or more Purchasers execute counterpart signature pages to this Agreement and deliver the Purchase Price to the Company (which date is referred to herein as the “Initial Closing”).

1.2.2	At any time and from time to time during the ninety (90) day period immediately following the Initial Closing (the “Additional Closing Period”), the Company may, at one or more additional closings (each an “Additional Closing” and together with the Initial Closing, each, a “Closing”), without obtaining the signature, consent or permission of any of the Purchasers in the Initial Closing or any prior Additional Closing, offer and sell to other investors (the “New Purchasers”), at a per share purchase price equal to the Purchase Price, up to that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock that is equal to that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock equal to the quotient of (x) Total Series Seed Investment Amount divided by (y) the Purchase Price, rounded up to the next whole share (the “Total Shares Authorized for Sale”) less the number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock actually issued and sold by the Company at the Initial Closing and any prior Additional Closings.  New Purchasers may include persons or entities who are already Purchasers under this Agreement.  The Company and each of the New Purchasers purchasing shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock at each Additional Closing will execute counterpart signature pages to this Agreement and each New Purchaser will, upon delivery by such New Purchaser and acceptance by the Company of such New Purchaser’s signature page and delivery of the Purchase Price by such New Purchaser to the Company, become a party to, and bound by, this Agreement to the same extent as if such New Purchaser had been a Purchaser at the Initial Closing and each such New Purchaser shall be deemed to be a Purchaser for all purposes under this Agreement as of the date of the applicable Additional Closing.

1.2.3 Promptly following each Closing, if required by the Company’s governing documents, the Company shall deliver to each Purchaser participating in such Closing a certificate representing the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock being purchased by such Purchaser at such Closing against payment of the Purchase Price therefor by check payable to the Company, by wire transfer to a bank account designated by the Company, by cancellation or conversion of indebtedness of the Company to Purchaser or by any combination of such methods.

(b) such Holder shall have notified the Company of the proposed disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and, at the expense of such Holder or its transferee, with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such disposition will not require registration of such securities under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5.1(a) and (b) above, no such registration statement or opinion of counsel shall be required: (i) for any transfer of any Securities in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rule 144 or Rule 144A, or (ii) for any transfer of any Securities by a Holder that is a partnership, limited liability company, a corporation or a venture capital fund to (A) a partner of such partnership, a member of such limited liability company or stockholder of such corporation, (B) an affiliate of such partnership, limited liability company or corporation (including, without limitation, any affiliated investment fund of such Holder), (C) a retired partner of such partnership or a retired member of such limited liability company, (D) the estate of any such partner, member or stockholder, or (iii) for the transfer by gift, will or intestate succession by any Holder to his or her spouse or lineal descendants or ancestors or any trust for any of the foregoing; provided that in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) the transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as if the transferee were an original Purchaser hereunder and in the case of clause (iii) the transfer was without additional consideration or at no greater than cost.

#### 5.2 “Market Stand-Off” Agreement.  

Each Holder hereby agrees that it shall not, to the extent requested by the Company or an underwriter of securities of the Company, sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any Securities or other shares of stock of the Company then owned by such Holder (other than to donees or partners of the Holder who agree to be similarly bound) for up to one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of any registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act; provided however that, if during the last seventeen (17) days of the restricted period the Company issues an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to the Company occurs, or prior to the expiration of the restricted period the Company announces that it will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the restricted period, and if the Company’s securities are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and Rule 2711 thereof applies, then the restrictions imposed by this Section 5.2 shall continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or material event; provided, further, that such automatic extension shall not apply to the extent that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has amended or repealed NASD Rule 2711(f)(4), or has otherwise provided written interpretive guidance regarding such rule, in each case, so as to eliminate the prohibition of any broker, dealer, or member of a national securities association from publishing or distributing any research report, with respect to the securities of an emerging growth company (as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012) prior to or after the expiration of any agreement between the broker, dealer, or member of a national securities association and the emerging growth company or its stockholders that restricts or prohibits the sale of securities held by the emerging growth company or its stockholders after the initial public offering date.  In no event will the restricted period extend beyond two hundred fifteen (215) days after the effective date of the registration statement. For purposes of this Section 5.2, the term “Company” shall include any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company into which the Company merges or consolidates.  To enforce the foregoing covenant, the Company shall have the right to place restrictive legends on the certificates representing the shares subject to this Section 5.2 and to impose stop transfer instructions with respect to the Securities and such other shares of stock of each Holder (and the shares or securities of every other person subject to the foregoing restriction) until the end of such period.  Each Holder further agrees to enter into any agreement reasonably required by the underwriters to implement the foregoing within any reasonable timeframe so requested.

#### 5.3 Drag Along Right. 

In the event that each of (i) the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding (other than those issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock), (ii) the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock then issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock then outstanding and (iii) the Board approve a Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in the Restated Charter), then each Stockholder (as defined herein) hereby agrees to vote (in person, by proxy or by action by written consent, as applicable) all shares of capital stock of the Company now or hereafter directly or indirectly owned of record or beneficially by such Stockholder (collectively, the "Shares") in favor of, and adopt, such Deemed Liquidation Event and to execute and deliver all related documentation and take such other action in support of the Deemed Liquidation Event as shall reasonably be requested by the Company in order to carry out the terms and provision of this Section 5.3, including without limitation executing and delivering instruments of conveyance and transfer, and any purchase agreement, merger agreement, indemnity agreement, escrow agreement, consent, waiver, governmental filing, share certificates duly endorsed for transfer (free and clear of impermissible liens, claims and encumbrances) and any similar or related documents.  The obligation of any party to take the actions required by this Section 5.3 shall not apply to a Deemed Liquidation Event where the other party involved in such Deemed Liquidation Event is an affiliate or stockholder of the Company holding more than 10% of the voting power of the Company.  "Stockholder" shall mean each Holder and Key Holder, and any transferee thereof.

#### 5.4 Exceptions to Drag Along Right. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Stockholder will not be required to comply with Section 5.3 above in connection with any proposed Sale of the Company (the “Proposed Sale”) unless:  

(a) any representations and warranties to be made by such Stockholder in connection with the Proposed Sale are limited to representations and warranties related to authority, ownership and the ability to convey title to such Shares, including but not limited to representations and warranties that (i) the Stockholder holds all right, title and interest in and to the Shares such Stockholder purports to hold, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (ii) the obligations of the Stockholder in connection with the transaction have been duly authorized, if applicable, (iii) the documents to be entered into by the Stockholder have been duly executed by the Stockholder and delivered to the acquirer and are enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with their respective terms and (iv) neither the execution and delivery of documents to be entered into in connection with the transaction, nor the performance of the Stockholder’s obligations thereunder, will cause a breach or violation of the terms of any agreement, law or judgment, order or decree of any court or governmental agency;

(b) the Stockholder shall not be liable for the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by any other Person in connection with the Proposed Sale, other than the Company (except to the extent that funds may be paid out of an escrow established to cover breach of representations, warranties and covenants of the Company as well as breach by any stockholder of any of identical representations, warranties and covenants provided by all stockholders);

(c) the liability for indemnification, if any, of such Stockholder in the Proposed Sale and for the inaccuracy of any representations and warranties made by the Company or its Stockholders in connection with such Proposed Sale, is several and not joint with any other Person (except to the extent that funds may be paid out of an escrow established to cover breach of representations, warranties and covenants of the Company as well as breach by any stockholder of any of identical representations, warranties and covenants provided by all stockholders), and except as required to satisfy the liquidity preference of the Series Seed Preferred Stock, if any, is pro rata in proportion to, and does not exceed, the amount of consideration paid to such Stockholder in connection with such Proposed Sale;  

(d) liability shall be limited to such Stockholder's applicable share (determined  based on the respective proceeds payable to each Stockholder in connection with such Proposed Sale in accordance with the provisions of the Restated Certificate) of a negotiated aggregate indemnification amount that applies equally to all Stockholders but that in no event exceeds the amount of consideration otherwise payable to such Stockholder in connection with such Proposed Sale, except with respect to claims related to  fraud by such Stockholder, the liability for which need not be limited as to such Stockholder;

(e) upon the consummation of the Proposed Sale, (i) each holder of each class or series of the Company’s stock will receive the same form of consideration for their shares of such class or series as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of such same class or series of stock unless the holders of at least a majority of Series Seed Preferred Stock elect otherwise,  (ii) each holder of a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock will receive the same amount of consideration per share of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of such same series, (iii) each holder of Common Stock will receive the same amount of consideration per share of Common Stock as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of Common Stock, and (iv) unless the holders of at least a majority of the Series Seed Preferred Stock elect to receive a lesser amount, the aggregate consideration receivable by all holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock shall be allocated among the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock on the basis of the relative liquidation preferences to which the holders of each respective series of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock are entitled in a Deemed Liquidation Event (assuming for this purpose that the Proposed Sale is a Deemed Liquidation Event) in accordance with the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation in effect immediately prior to the Proposed Sale.

### 6. PARTICIPATION RIGHT.

#### 6.1 General.  

Each Major Purchaser has the right of first refusal to purchase such Major Purchaser’s Pro Rata Share (as defined below) of all (or any part) of any New Securities (as defined in Section 6.2 below) that the Company may from time to time issue after the date of this Agreement, provided, however, such Major Purchaser shall have no right to purchase any such New Securities if such Major Purchaser cannot demonstrate to the Company’s reasonable satisfaction that such Major Purchaser is at the time of the proposed issuance of such New Securities an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act.  A Major Purchaser’s “Pro Rata Share” for purposes of this right of first refusal is the ratio of (a) the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock owned by such Major Purchaser, to (b) the Fully-Diluted Share Number.

#### 6.2 New Securities.  

“New Securities” shall mean any Common Stock or Preferred Stock of the Company, whether now authorized or not, and rights, options or warrants to purchase such Common Stock or Preferred Stock, and securities of any type whatsoever that are, or may become, convertible or exchangeable into such Common Stock or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the term “New Securities” does not include: (a) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the outstanding shares of all the series of the Preferred Stock; (b) shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of any options, warrants or rights to purchase any securities of the Company outstanding as of the Agreement Date and any securities issuable upon the conversion thereof; (c) shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued in connection with any stock split or stock dividend or recapitalization; (d) shares of Common Stock (or options, warrants or rights therefor) granted or issued hereafter to employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants or advisers to, the Company or any subsidiary of the Company pursuant to incentive agreements, stock purchase or stock option plans, stock bonuses or awards, warrants, contracts or other arrangements that are approved by the Board; (e) shares of the Company’s Series Seed Preferred Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement; (f) any other shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (and/or options or warrants therefor) issued or issuable primarily for other than equity financing purposes and approved by the Board; and (g) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable by the Company to the public pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act.

#### 6.3 Procedures.  

In the event that the Company proposes to undertake an issuance of New Securities, it shall give to each Major Purchaser a written notice of its intention to issue New Securities (the “Notice”), describing the type of New Securities and the price and the general terms upon which the Company proposes to issue such New Securities given in accordance with Section 8.5.  Each Major Purchaser shall have ten (10) days from the date such Notice is effective, as determined pursuant to Section 8.5 based upon the manner or method of notice, to agree in writing to purchase such Major Purchaser’s Pro Rata Share of such New Securities for the price and upon the general terms specified in the Notice by giving written notice to the Company and stating therein the quantity of New Securities to be purchased (not to exceed such Major Purchaser’s Pro Rata Share).   

#### 6.4 Failure to Exercise.  

In the event that the Major Purchasers fail to exercise in full the right of first refusal within such ten (10) day period, then the Company shall have one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter to sell the New Securities with respect to which the Major Purchasers’ rights of first refusal hereunder were not exercised, at a price and upon general terms not materially more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in the Company’s Notice to the Major Purchasers.  In the event that the Company has not issued and sold the New Securities within such one hundred twenty (120) day period, then the Company shall not thereafter issue or sell any New Securities without again first offering such New Securities to the Major Purchasers pursuant to this Section 6.

### 7. ELECTION OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

#### 7.1 Voting; Board Composition.  

Subject to the rights of the stockholders of the Company to remove a director for cause in accordance with applicable law, during the term of this Agreement, each Stockholder agrees to vote (or consent pursuant to an action by written consent of the stockholders of the Company) all shares of capital stock of the Company now or hereafter directly or indirectly owned of record or beneficially by such Stockholder (the “Voting Shares”), or to cause such Voting Shares to be voted, in such manner as may be necessary to elect (and maintain in office) as the members of the Board:

(a) that number of individuals, if any, equal to the Common Board Member Count (each, a “Common Board Designee” and, collectively, the “Common Board Designees”) designated from time to time in a writing delivered to the Company and signed by Common Control Holders who, at the time in question, hold shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company then held by all Common Control Holders;    

(b) that number of individuals, if any, equal to the Series Seed Board Member Count (each, a “Series Seed Board Designee” and, collectively, the “Series Seed Board Designees”) designated from time to time in a writing delivered to the Company and signed by Purchasers who, at the time in question, hold a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement;

(c) that number of individuals, if any, equal to the Mutual Consent Board Member Count (each, a “Mutual Consent Board Designee” and, collectively, the “Mutual Consent Board Designees” and, together with any Common Board Designee and any Seed Board Designee, each a “Board Designee”) designated from time to time in a writing delivered to the Company and signed by (a) Purchasers who, at the time in question, hold a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement and (b) Common Control Holders who, at the time in question, hold shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company then held by all Common Control Holders.

Subject to the rights of the stockholders of the Company to remove a director for cause in accordance with applicable law, during the term of this Agreement, no Stockholder shall take any action to remove an incumbent Board Designee or to designate a new Board Designee unless such removal and/or designation of a Board Designee is approved in a writing signed by the parties entitled to designate such Board Designee above. Each Stockholder hereby appoints the then current Chief Executive Officer of the Company,  as such Stockholder’s true and lawful proxy and attorney, with the power to act alone and with full power of substitution, to vote all shares of the Company’s capital stock held by such Stockholder as set forth in this Agreement and to execute all appropriate instruments consistent with this Agreement on behalf of such Stockholder if, and only if, such Stockholder (a) fails to vote or (b) attempts to vote (whether by proxy, in person or by written consent), in a manner which is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, all of such Stockholder’s Voting Shares or execute such other instruments in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement within five (5) days of the Company’s or any other party’s written request for such Stockholder’s written consent or signature.  The proxy and power granted by each Stockholder pursuant to this Section are coupled with an interest and are given to secure the performance of such party’s duties under this Agreement.  Each such proxy and power will be irrevocable for the term hereof.  The proxy and power, so long as any party hereto is an individual, will survive the death, incompetency and disability of such party or any other individual Stockholder of Voting Shares and, so long as any party hereto is an entity, will survive the merger or reorganization of such party or any other entity holding Voting Shares.
