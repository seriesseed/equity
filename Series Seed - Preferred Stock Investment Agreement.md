1.1.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each investor listed as a "Purchaser" on Schedule 1 (each, a "Purchaser") shall purchase at the applicable Closing and the Company agrees to sell and issue to each Purchaser at such Closing that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock of the Company ("Series Seed Preferred Stock") set forth opposite such Purchaser's name on Schedule 1, at a purchase price per share equal to the Purchase Price. 

#### 1.2 Closing; Delivery.

1.2.1 The initial purchase and sale of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock hereunder shall take place remotely via the exchange of documents and signatures on the Agreement Date or the subsequent date on which one or more Purchasers execute counterpart signature pages to this Agreement and deliver the Purchase Price to the Company (which date is referred to herein as the "Initial Closing").

1.2.2 At any time and from time to time during the ninety (90) day period immediately following the Initial Closing (the "Additional Closing Period"), the Company may, at one or more additional closings (each an "Additional Closing" and together with the Initial Closing, each, a "Closing"), without obtaining the signature, consent or permission of any of the Purchasers in the Initial Closing or any prior Additional Closing, offer and sell to other investors (the "New Purchasers"), at a per share purchase price equal to the Purchase Price, up to that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock that is equal to that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock equal to the quotient of (x) Total Series Seed Investment Amount divided by (y) the Purchase Price, rounded up to the next whole share (the "Total Shares Authorized for Sale") less the number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock actually issued and sold by the Company at the Initial Closing and any prior Additional Closings.  New Purchasers may include persons or entities who are already Purchasers under this Agreement.  The Company and each of the New Purchasers purchasing shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock at each Additional Closing will execute counterpart signature pages to this Agreement and each New Purchaser will, upon delivery by such New Purchaser and acceptance by the Company of such New Purchaser's signature page and delivery of the Purchase Price by such New Purchaser to the Company, become a party to, and bound by, this Agreement to the same extent as if such New Purchaser had been a Purchaser at the Initial Closing and each such New Purchaser shall be deemed to be a Purchaser for all purposes under this Agreement as of the date of the applicable Additional Closing.

1.2.3 Promptly following each Closing, if required by the Company's governing documents, the Company shall deliver to each Purchaser participating in such Closing a certificate representing the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock being purchased by such Purchaser at such Closing against payment of the Purchase Price therefor by check payable to the Company, by wire transfer to a bank account designated by the Company, by cancellation or conversion of indebtedness of the Company to Purchaser or by any combination of such methods.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5.1(a) and (b), no such registration statement or opinion of counsel will be required: (i) for any transfer of any Securities in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 144 or Rule 144A, or (ii) for any transfer of any Securities by a Holder that is a partnership, limited liability company, a corporation, or a venture capital fund to (A) a partner of such partnership, a member of such limited liability company, or stockholder of such corporation, (B) an affiliate of such partnership, limited liability company or corporation (including, any affiliated investment fund of such Holder), (C) a retired partner of such partnership or a retired member of such limited liability company, (D) the estate of any such partner, member, or stockholder, or (iii) for the transfer without additional consideration or at no greater than cost by gift, will, or intestate succession by any Holder to the Holder's spouse or lineal descendants or ancestors or any trust for any of the foregoing; provided that, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), the transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as if the transferee were an original Purchaser under this Agreement.

#### 5.2 “Market Stand-Off” Agreement.  

To the extent requested by the Company or an underwriter of securities of the Company, each Holder shall not sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any Securities or other shares of stock of the Company then owned by such Holder (other than to donees or partners of the Holder who agree to be similarly bound) for up to 180 days following the effective date of any registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act; provided however that, if during the last 17 days of the restricted period the Company issues an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to the Company occurs, or before the expiration of the restricted period the Company announces that it will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the restricted period, and if the Company's securities are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and Rule 2711 thereof applies, then the restrictions imposed by this Section 5.2 will continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or material event; provided, further, that such automatic extension will not apply to the extent that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has amended or repealed NASD Rule 2711(f)(4), or has otherwise provided written interpretive guidance regarding such rule, in each case, so as to eliminate the prohibition of any broker, dealer, or member of a national securities association from publishing or distributing any research report, with respect to the securities of an "emerging growth company" (as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012) before or after the expiration of any agreement between the broker, dealer, or member of a national securities association and the emerging growth company or its stockholders that restricts or prohibits the sale of securities held by the emerging growth company or its stockholders after the initial public offering date.  In no event will the restricted period extend beyond 215 days after the effective date of the registration statement. For purposes of this Section 5.2, "Company" includes any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company into which the Company merges or consolidates.  The Company may place restrictive legends on the certificates representing the shares subject to this Section 5.2 and may impose stop transfer instructions with respect to the Securities and such other shares of stock of each Holder (and the shares or securities of every other person subject to the foregoing restriction) until the end of such period.  Each Holder shall enter into any agreement reasonably required by the underwriters to implement the foregoing within any reasonable timeframe so requested.

#### 5.3 Drag Along Right. 

If a Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in the Restated Charter) is approved by each of (i) the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock then-outstanding (other than those issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock), (ii) the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock then issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock then-outstanding and (iii) the Board, then each Stockholder shall vote (in person, by proxy or by action by written consent, as applicable) all shares of capital stock of the Company now or hereafter directly or indirectly owned of record or beneficially by such Stockholder (collectively, the "Shares") in favor of, and adopt, such Deemed Liquidation Event and to execute and deliver all related documentation and take such other action in support of the Deemed Liquidation Event as may reasonably be requested by the Company to carry out the terms and provision of this Section 5.3, including executing and delivering instruments of conveyance and transfer, and any purchase agreement, merger agreement, indemnity agreement, escrow agreement, consent, waiver, governmental filing, share certificates duly endorsed for transfer (free and clear of impermissible liens, claims and encumbrances) and any similar or related documents.  The obligation of any party to take the actions required by this Section 5.3 will not apply to a Deemed Liquidation Event if the other party involved in such Deemed Liquidation Event is an affiliate or stockholder of the Company holding more than 10% of the voting power of the Company.  "Stockholder" means each Holder and Key Holder, and any transferee thereof.

#### 5.4 Exceptions to Drag Along Right. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Stockholder need not comply with Section 5.3 above in connection with any proposed Sale of the Company (the "Proposed Sale") unless:  

(a) any representations and warranties to be made by the Stockholder in connection with the Proposed Sale are limited to representations and warranties related to authority, ownership and the ability to convey title to such Shares, including representations and warranties that (i) the Stockholder holds all right, title and interest in and to the Shares the Stockholder purports to hold, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (ii) the obligations of the Stockholder in connection with the transaction have been duly authorized, if applicable, (iii) the documents to be entered into by the Stockholder have been duly executed by the Stockholder and delivered to the acquirer and are enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with their respective terms and, (iv) neither the execution and delivery of documents to be entered into in connection with the transaction, nor the performance of the Stockholder's obligations thereunder, will cause a breach or violation of the terms of any agreement, law, or judgment, order, or decree of any court or governmental agency;

(b) the Stockholder will not be liable for the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by any other Person in connection with the Proposed Sale, other than the Company (except to the extent that funds may be paid out of an escrow established to cover breach of representations, warranties, and covenants of the Company as well as breach by any stockholder of any identical representations, warranties and covenants provided by all stockholders);

(c) the liability for indemnification, if any, of the Stockholder in the Proposed Sale and for the inaccuracy of any representations and warranties made by the Company or its Stockholders in connection with such Proposed Sale, is several and not joint with any other Person (except to the extent that funds may be paid out of an escrow established to cover breach of representations, warranties and covenants of the Company as well as breach by any stockholder of any identical representations, warranties, and covenants provided by all stockholders), and except as required to satisfy the liquidation preference of the Series Seed Preferred Stock, if any, is pro rata in proportion to, and does not exceed, the amount of consideration paid to such Stockholder in connection with such Proposed Sale;  

(d) liability will be limited to the Stockholder's applicable share (determined  based on the respective proceeds payable to each Stockholder in connection with the Proposed Sale in accordance with the provisions of the Restated Charter) of a negotiated aggregate indemnification amount that applies equally to all Stockholders but that in no event exceeds the amount of consideration otherwise payable to the Stockholder in connection with the Proposed Sale, except with respect to claims related to  fraud by the Stockholder, the liability for which need not be limited as to the Stockholder;

(e) upon the consummation of the Proposed Sale, (i) each holder of each class or series of the Company's stock will receive the same form of consideration for their shares of such class or series as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of such same class or series of stock unless the holders of at least a majority of Series Seed Preferred Stock elect otherwise,  (ii) each holder of a series of Series Seed Preferred Stock will receive the same amount of consideration per share of such series of Series Seed Preferred Stock as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of such same series, (iii) each holder of Common Stock will receive the same amount of consideration per share of Common Stock as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of Common Stock, and (iv) unless the holders of at least a majority of the Series Seed Preferred Stock elect to receive a lesser amount, the aggregate consideration receivable by all holders of the Preferred Stock and Common Stock shall be allocated among the holders of Preferred Stock and Common Stock on the basis of the relative liquidation preferences to which the holders of each respective series of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock are entitled in a Deemed Liquidation Event (assuming for this purpose that the Proposed Sale is a Deemed Liquidation Event) in accordance with the Company's Restated Charter in effect immediately prior to the Proposed Sale.
